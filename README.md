## About

This project recreates the nostalgic experience of playing classic boundary-filling games from the Amstrad CPC era. As a young kid, I remember playing this type of game on my 6128 Amstrad computer - the kind of simple yet addictive gameplay that defined early gaming.

## How to Play

**Objective**: Cover as much area as possible by shrinking the walls while avoiding the bouncing ball!

**Controls**:
- Use **arrow keys** to shrink the walls
- The ball will bounce off the walls
- If the ball hits a wall while you're moving it, game over!
- You have 100 seconds to cover as much area as possible

**Scoring System**:
- **Coverage Points**: 100 points per 1% of area covered
- **Efficiency Bonus**: Extra points for covering more area quickly
- **Final Score**: Your performance is ranked from BEGINNER to LEGENDARY!
